### Exercise 4: Real-World Scenarios

**Objective:** Understand the real risks of over-reliance on AI.

Answer these three scenarios in a short markdown file:

1. **Interview:**
   You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?
```
If I have always relied on AI to design systems, I will not understand the different design patterns/ architectures for caching systems and the pro's and con's for each. I will not be able to understand the best choice depending on the use case or requirements properly. It will reflect me as an individual who do not practice critical thinking and problem solving skills.
```

2. **Production Bug:**
   At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?
```
I have practice different debugging techniques. The first step is to always try to find the root cause of the bug. If we have an error report, it can help us find where the bug happens. We can also use logging, print statements or debugger to trace where the bug happens. After that we can find where are the different areas/ dependencies that might have caused the bug. If we have prepared a good test suite, it can also help us narrow down and find the possible cause of the bug.
```

3. **New Technology:**
   A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?
```
Documentation is always a good place to start. I always prefer to do some simple trial and error to understand how the library works.
I have instances where a new version of a library is released but AI doesn't know about it yet. In one case, the usage of the library hace changed significantly. So I went to test the most basic usage as demostrated by the documentation, And slowly implement features to what I need.
```

**Reflection:**
Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.
```
Instead of relying on AI to generate complete solutions, I use AI to explore different approaches (design choices and implementation strategies) and understand the concepts better. This helps me build a good foundation and practice my critical thinking and problem solving skills.
So when faced with real-world challenges, instead of just thinking about asking AI for a solution, I will try to break down the problem and understand the requirements first. This way we can evaluate the different options on the small building blocks and how they fit into the big picture.
