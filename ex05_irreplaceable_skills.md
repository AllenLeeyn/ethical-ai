### Exercise 5: Building Irreplaceable Skills

**Objective:** Identify the human skills that separate good coders from AI users.

Rate yourself (1–5) in each skill and plan improvements:

| Skill                    | Description                               | Rating | Improvement Plan |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Problem Decomposition    | Breaking down problems logically          | 4/5    | Don't overcomplicate by breaking it down to too small |
| Systems Thinking         | Understanding how components interact     | 3/5    | There is still a lot to learn about systems on a lower level and larger scale |
| Critical Evaluation      | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | 3/5    | Learn and understand the different evaluation techniques |
| Debugging Mindset        | Investigating unexpected behavior         | 3/5    | Overreliance on print. After finding where the error occurs, there must be a better way to find the culprit |
| Conceptual Understanding | Knowing WHY, not just HOW                 | 4/5    | Question more of why certain standards exist |

Choose your lowest-rated skill and write **3 specific actions** you'll take this week to improve it without relying on AI.
```
Skill: Critical Evaluation
1. Search on what are the different parameters to evaluate.
2. Learn about code smells and anti-patterns.
3. Learn about the ways to evaluate code using test coverage, performance benchmarks etc.
