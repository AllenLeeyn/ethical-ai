## Exercise 3: The Fairness Contract

**Objective:** Define your personal rules for ethical AI use in learning.

Create a markdown file `fairness_contract.md` with three sections:

**I will use AI when:**

- I have tried solving a problem myself.
- I need to understand _why_ something works.
- I want to explore alternative approaches.

**I will NOT use AI when:**

- I haven't tried the problem on my own.
- I am completing an exam or assessment.
- I am still learning fundamental concepts.

**I know I'm using AI fairly when:**

- I can explain my code without AI's help.
- I could solve a similar problem independently.
- I feel more confident in my own understanding.

Sign and date your contract.
