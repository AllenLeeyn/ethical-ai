## Quest 0: Learning to Use AI Ethically as a Coder

### Overview

Before starting with AI ethics, bias, or safety, this quest focuses on something more fundamental: **how to use AI to learn, not to skip learning**.
This first quest will help you build the right habits for lifelong learning - using AI to think deeper, not faster.
If your only skill is writing code that AI can already write, you are replaceable. Your goal is to become _irreplaceable_ by developing judgment, systems thinking, and a strong understanding of what you build.

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between using AI to get answers and using AI to learn.
- Practice the right workflow: **attempt → verify → reflect**.
- Build a personal code of ethics for AI use in learning.
- Recognize the professional risks of over-reliance on AI.
- Identify key human skills that make coders irreplaceable.

### Exercises of the quest

_Note: All submitted answers will be scanned using an AI Detector.
If your response is identified as being generated by an AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.), it will be rejected.
Make sure to write answers in your own words and avoid copying AI-generated text._

- **Exercise 0:** Honest Reflection on AI Use
- **Exercise 1:** The Palindrome Challenge
- **Exercise 2:** Strengthening Through Variations
- **Exercise 3:** The Fairness Contract
- **Exercise 4:** Real-World Scenarios
- **Exercise 5:** Building Irreplaceable Skills

### Virtual Environment

- Python 3.9+ or any preferred language for testing exercises.
- Access to a language model (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) - but **only after** your first attempt at each exercise.

### Exercise 0: Honest Reflection on AI Use

**Objective:** Understand your current relationship with AI in coding and learning.

1. Write short, honest answers to these questions:
   - How have you used AI for coding so far?
   - Do you usually try problems yourself first?
   - Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help?
   - What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?

2. Identify your current pattern:
   - **Learner A:** uses AI as an _answer generator_.
   - **Learner B:** uses AI as a _learning amplifier_.

3. Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.

### Exercise 1: The Palindrome Challenge

**Objective:** Experience the difference between using AI as a shortcut and using it as a learning tool.

#### Step 1 - Do it yourself

1. Write pseudocode for a function that checks if a string is a palindrome.
2. Implement your solution in Python.
3. Test with examples like `"racecar"`, `"hello"`, and `"A man a plan a canal Panama"`.
4. Add comments explaining your reasoning.

#### Step 2 - Use AI to learn

Now that your function works, use AI to go deeper:

```text
"I wrote a palindrome function. Here's my code:
[insert your code]

What's the time complexity?
What edge cases might I miss?
Are there better approaches?"
```

#### Step 3 - Reflection

- What did you learn from solving it before asking AI?
- How is your understanding different now?
- Could you now write similar functions (e.g., reverse a string) without help?

---

---

### Exercise 2: Strengthening Through Variations

**Objective:** Extend your solution and practice independent problem-solving.

1. Modify your palindrome function to:
   - Ignore spaces and punctuation.
   - Be case-insensitive.
   - Return the position where the string stops being a palindrome (if not one).

2. After your first attempt, ask AI:

```text
"I modified my palindrome function to handle more cases.
Did I miss anything? Can it be more efficient?"
```

3. Reflect on what AI added that you didn't consider initially.

### Exercise 3: The Fairness Contract

**Objective:** Define your personal rules for ethical AI use in learning.

Create a markdown file `fairness_contract.md` with three sections:

**I will use AI when:**

- I have tried solving a problem myself.
- I need to understand _why_ something works.
- I want to explore alternative approaches.

**I will NOT use AI when:**

- I haven't tried the problem on my own.
- I am completing an exam or assessment.
- I am still learning fundamental concepts.

**I know I'm using AI fairly when:**

- I can explain my code without AI's help.
- I could solve a similar problem independently.
- I feel more confident in my own understanding.

Sign and date your contract.

### Exercise 4: Real-World Scenarios

**Objective:** Understand the real risks of over-reliance on AI.

Answer these three scenarios in a short markdown file:

1. **Interview:**
   You're asked to explain a caching system design. What happens if you've always relied on AI to design systems?

2. **Production Bug:**
   At 2 AM, you must debug code generated by AI months ago - but AI is offline. Can you fix it?

3. **New Technology:**
   A new library is released, and AI hasn't been trained on it yet. How do you learn it?

**Reflection:**
Write one paragraph explaining how using AI fairly today prepares you for real-world challenges like these.

### Exercise 5: Building Irreplaceable Skills

**Objective:** Identify the human skills that separate good coders from AI users.

Rate yourself (1–5) in each skill and plan improvements:

| Skill                    | Description                               | Rating | Improvement Plan |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Problem Decomposition    | Breaking down problems logically          | \_/5   |                  |
| Systems Thinking         | Understanding how components interact     | \_/5   |                  |
| Critical Evaluation      | Knowing when code is wrong or inefficient | \_/5   |                  |
| Debugging Mindset        | Investigating unexpected behavior         | \_/5   |                  |
| Conceptual Understanding | Knowing WHY, not just HOW                 | \_/5   |                  |

Choose your lowest-rated skill and write **3 specific actions** you'll take this week to improve it without relying on AI.

### Final Reminder

Learners who use AI to skip learning improve quickly - for a few weeks. Then they plateau.
Learners who use AI to learn, reflect, and reason deeply keep growing forever.
Be the second kind.
