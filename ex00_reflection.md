### Exercise 0: Honest Reflection on AI Use

**Objective:** Understand your current relationship with AI in coding and learning.

1. Write short, honest answers to these questions:
   - How have you used AI for coding so far?
```
   I have been trying to minimize my use of AI for coding. I initially try to attempt the problem in my own way and ask AI for review and suggestions for my solutions. However, I have started to use AI more in the initial stages of a task/ problem. But I always breakdown the problem and use AI to plan and understand the options before proceeding. Generally, I use AI for planning and code review.
```
   - Do you usually try problems yourself first?
```
   Yes, I usually attempt the problems in some ways before asking AI for help. I have started to use AI for more boilerplate code generation. I usually go through a planning phase and use AI to implement the logic in steps if I do use AI for coding.
```
   - Can you explain code you've submitted without AI's help?
```
   Yes, when using AI for coding, I go through each steps or iteration of the logic with the AI. And I will read and review the code. Usually, I will question the logic and try to make changes along with a trial and error approach to reach where I think is good. 
   In many cases, I try to keep my own logic or preference to see how it will work in the long run. And this have help me understand why certain things are done in a certain way.
```
   - What would happen if AI was unavailable during an exam or job test?
```
   It will be difficult but I think I can come up with something working (but ugly or inefficient). I always aim to understand the concepts and the basic building blocks of coding. I hope that event without AI help, I can eventually come up with a working solution.
```
2. Identify your current pattern:
   - **Learner A:** uses AI as an _answer generator_.
   - **Learner B:** uses AI as a _learning amplifier_.
```
   I identify as Learner B: uses AI as a learning amplifier.
```

3. Write a short paragraph describing where you are today and what type of learner you want to become.
```
I have been limiting my AI use to focus more on learning and understanding concepts. I think in many ways, I am the learner I want to be.
However, it will be better if I can use AI more effectively to learn faster and deeper. I have find that with the use of AI, I can go through an iteration of trial and error faster. I guess I could use AI to write test cases for even faster feedback and testing.
