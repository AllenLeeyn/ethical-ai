## Quest 0: Learning to Use AI Ethically as a Coder

As the adoption of AI tools increases, we as coders and learners needs to understand the consequences of over-reliance on AI. Ai can be a powerful tool to improve productivity, but it can also take away the opportunity to learn and develop critical thinking skills. As learners and coders, it is important to understand the importance of the basic building blocks and concepts. This quest aims to illustrate the importance of using AI ethically to enhance learning, rather than replacing it.

Using AI ethocally means that we don't surrender our thinking process to AI. Instead, we take responsibility for our own learning and decision making when writing our solutions. This involves attempting problems ourselves first, verifying AI-generated solutions, and reflecting on our learning process.

I have been practicing using AI as a Learning Amplifier. I have been using more AI for that past 6 months. I think important thing here is to understand when I can use AI as a productivity tool. And when I should try and learn first before asking AI.
